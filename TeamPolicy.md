## Emergency / Issues 
If a teammate has an issue meeting a deadline for any reason, they should contact their teammates as soon as possible, as soon as you have the doubt. In these cases, teammates should reprioritize their work and continue on ahead.

**The Teammate** is expected to make up for it during the next phases. 

If someone is unreachable, mio should be used as a alternative way of communication.
